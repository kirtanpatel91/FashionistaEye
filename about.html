        <p>Hi everyone! My name's Karishma and I created this blog to pursue my passions.
          Sharing those passions with others around me gives me joy which is why I created FashionistaEye.
          I'm excited to share my wonderings and experiences with you all,
          so feel free to explore my site and let me know what you think!</p>
